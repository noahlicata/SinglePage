            Listed below are my skills and languages for front end, back end,
            and full stack roles. In addition to these, I also have experience
            with GitHub, using CLI commands, and the process of application
            deployment.

            <h2>Front End</h2>
            <p>
              With knowledge of graphic design concepts, I know the difference a
              good looking and functional front end can make. I enjoy creating
              captivating and intuitive front end code using JavaScript, HTML,
              CSS, React, Redux, Bootstrap and Tailwind.

            <h2>Back End</h2>
            <p>
              What good is a clean front end without the structure and stability
              of a reliable and efficient back end? I have experience using Ruby
              on Rails to create models, tables, controllers and relationships,
              serialize data responses for RESTful APIs, and maintain clean
              databases.

            <h2>Full Stack</h2>
            <p>
              Need both? No problem. From handling user authentication,
              authorization, cookies and sessions, to creating multi-page,
              mobile responsive front end components using React, I have the
              tools and knowledge to piece together the whole application.

              <p>
                AutoMatik is an online vehicle shopping application with a
                client side and an admin side. Users can browse through the
                selection of cars, use different filters to narrow down their
                searches, and save any favorites to their likes for later
                viewing. Admins can upload new vehicles to the database, and see
                a wide range of statistics about customers, sales, top selling
                brands, and much more. Made over the course of three weeks, this
                application uses React for the front end, and Ruby on Rails for
                the back end.

                This project is an informational application for the upcoming
                (and in no way fabricated) Denver City Limits music festival.
                Users can browse through the lineup of artists, read their bios,
                and use the schedule page to see when each artist is playing,
                and on which stage. Users can also sign in to purchase tickets,
                which are available in two tiers, General Admission and VIP.
                Made over the course of just seven days, this project uses React
                for the front end, and Ruby on Rails for the back end.

          <h2>Full Stack Developer, Musician, Husband, Dog Enthusiast</h2>
          <p>
            I am a lifelong multi-instrumentalist, live performer, music
            producer and DJ, specializing in the blending of obscure genres. I
            started my creative journey at just three years old, with my first
            instruments being drums and piano. I went on to host my first solo
            concert at seven years old, and continued to perform for many years
            either as an opener for other artists, or as a solo performer at my
            own conerts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm happily married to my lovely wife, Stacy, who works in the
            beauty industry. We have two husky mixes, Kaya and Odie, who create
            a humorous (and sometimes chaotic) atmosphere here at our small
            house in Broomfield, CO.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working as a freelance web designer. I've always had
            a passion for computers and electronics, and I'm thrilled that I've
            found such a special connection to writing code. I take pride in the
            unique perspective on creativity that music has given me, as well as
            a meticulous attention to detail and the ability to pick up and
            learn new things quickly. I thrive equally as an individual, as well
            as in a group. I'm very easy to work with, and would love to make a
            valuable addition to your team!
